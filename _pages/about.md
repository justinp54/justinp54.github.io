### About this site.
This website is a **long-term academic portfolio** that also serves as a **personal research and study log**.

My primary interests are in **`bioinformatics`**, particularly **protein structure modeling and protein-ligand interactions**, and in how modern **machine learning models** can be used to understand and predict these systems.

This site focueses on **documenting my learning process**: how I read papers, understand equations, interpret algorithms, and gradually build research ideas.

### What you will find here.
 - **Paper Reviews** — Structured reading notes on machine learning and bioinformatics papers
 - **Journal** — Short, informal entries documenting my study process, experiments, and occasional side interests
 - **Projects** — Research, course, and personal projects related to machine learning, bioinformatics, and scientific modeling
 - **Publication & CV** — A curated record of academic outputs and experiences as they develop. The materials can be found at [CV](/cv/) and [Publications](/publications/) pages

### Current focus.
- Protein–ligand interaction modeling
- Protein structure representations and embeddings
- Generative models (diffusion and flow-based methods)
- Machine learning for biological and chemical systems
